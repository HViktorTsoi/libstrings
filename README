libstrings

libstrings is a free software library for reading and writing TES IV: Skyrim's
.STRINGS, .DLSTRINGS and .ILSTRINGS files.

Note: This library is very much a work in progress and subject to significant
change. It is not release-ready.

If a file is loaded then saved by libstrings, the order of strings and 
directory entries within the file may not match their order in the original
file. This does not affect Skyrim's handling of the files, as the order does 
not matter to it.

libstrings will automatically clean out any unreferenced strings when it saves
a file. This can be avoided by getting an array of such strings using
GetUnreferencedStrings then assigning them IDs and adding them back in.

Known Issues:

  * Editing functions are untested.
  * No docs.
  
Planned Enhancements:

  * Thread safety.
