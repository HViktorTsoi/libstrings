libstrings

libstrings is a free software library for reading and writing TES V: Skyrim's
.STRINGS, .DLSTRINGS and .ILSTRINGS files.

Please see the HTML readme file at libstrings-readme.html for
more information.


Build Instructions
==================

These instructions assume you are building on Windows. No Windows-specific code is used to the best of my knowledge, however, building on other platforms is untested.

All paths are given relative to the top level of the libstrings source code, ie. the folder in which this readme lies.

Requirements:

  * Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition
    - <http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express>
	- Proffesional Edition will also work.
  * Boost C++ Libraries
    - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/> (Tested with v1.51.0)
	- Download the latest 7-zipped source code.
	- Tested with v1.51.0.
  * UTF8-CPP
    - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/utfcpp/>
	- Download the latest zipped v2.x source code.
	- Tested with v2.3.2.
	
	
Preparing Requirements:

  1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 if you haven't already.
  2. Create an 'externals' folder in the top-level folder of the libstrings source, beside this readme file.
  3. Create a 'utf8' folder inside the 'externals' folder.
  4. Place the folders inside the UTF8-CPP archive you downloaded (should be 'source', 'doc') into the 'utf8' folder.
  5. Prepare Boost (see instructions below).
  
  Preparing Boost:
  
    1. Create a 'boost' folder inside your 'externals' folder.
	2. Extract the downloaded Boost archive to your 'boost' folder, so that (for example) 'b2.exe' is at 'externals/boost/b2.exe'.
	3. Start a Command Prompt and cd to 'externals/boost'.
	4. Run 'bootstrap.bat' from the Command Prompt window.
	5. Run 'b2 --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete stage' from the Command Prompt. This will take a long time.
	6. Rename 'externals/boost/stage/lib' to 'externals/boost/stage/lib-32'.
	7. To build 64 bit binaries:
	  a. Run 'b2 --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete --address-model=64 stage' from the Command Prompt. This will take a long time.
	  b. Rename 'externals/boost/stage/lib' to 'externals/boost/stage/lib-64'.
	  

Building libstrings:

  1. Open the 'libstrings.sln' file in Visual C++ 2010.
  2. Set the build configuration, selecting build type and architecture:
    - 'Release' will build the library as a DLL.
	- 'StaticRelease' will build the library as a static .lib library.
  3. Select Build->Build Solution to build the library and the tester application. The tester application is not necessary for use of the library, but it takes seconds to build any may serve as a useful example.
  4. Binaries are located in 'bin/<type>-<architecture>', eg. 'bin/StaticRelease-32'.
