libstrings

libstrings is a free software library for reading and writing TES IV: Skyrim's
.STRINGS, .DLSTRINGS and .ILSTRINGS files.

Note: This library is very much a work in progress and subject to significant
change. It is not release-ready.

If a file that was not created or last saved with libstrings is loaded then
saved by libstrings, the order of strings and directory entries within the file
may not match their order in the original file. This does not affect Skyrim's
handling of the files, as the order does not matter to it.

Once a file has been saved by libstrings, its contents will not be re-ordered
upon future saves, so long as all saves are done by libstrings. Saving the
file with another program may result in that program changing the order of
contents once again.

libstrings will automatically clean out any unreferenced strings when it saves
a file. This can be avoided by getting an array of such strings using
GetUnreferencedStrings then assigning them IDs and adding them back in.

Known Issues:

  * Closing the file handle is ridiculously slow.
  * Editing functions are untested.
  * No docs.
  
Planned Enhancements:

  * Thread safety.
